### Built With

As well as developing full stack skills I was also keen to use Next.js to speed up page loading and optimise the caching of pages. I also wanted to develope my TypeScript skills to enable my applcation to be more stable. Here is the full list of the full tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
